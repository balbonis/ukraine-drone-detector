The models and detections produced by this application:
	•	Do not represent real-time military or surveillance intelligence.
	•	Are based solely on visual patterns and open-source references.
	•	May contain inaccuracies or false positives, especially in complex environments.

Use of this system should be done with awareness of its experimental nature, and not for critical defense, navigation, or emergency response purposes.
